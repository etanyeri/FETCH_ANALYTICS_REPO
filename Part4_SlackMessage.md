Subject: Data Model Update – New Structure for Product and Sales Insights

Hi Alex,

I wanted to share an update on our data model improvements that will make accessing product and sales details more efficient for reporting and analysis.
I've created a new model called factReceiptItems that organizes product information and sales details in a way that’s easier to navigate and query.
This will allow us to quickly access insights about products, sales metrics, and other relevant details that can support strategic 
decision-making.

During the process, I also noticed some data quality issues, such as missing values in important fields and inconsistent formatting 
(like state abbreviations). I’m addressing these to ensure our data is consistent and reliable, particularly for fields like purchaseDate
and totalSpent, which are critical to our analyses.

Additionally, I've structured this model to scale with our dataset growth, using some efficiency tactics I applied in past projects, 
such as optimizing API usage to ensure faster data access and reliability.

Please let me know if there’s anything specific you’d like me to prioritize or any additional insights you’d like from this model.

Thanks,
Elif
