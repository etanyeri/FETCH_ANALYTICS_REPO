Subject: Data Model Update – New Structure for Product and Sales Insights

Hi Alex,

I wanted to share an update on the recent improvements I’ve made to our data model. I've created a new factReceiptItems model that organizes product and sales information more effectively, making it easier to extract detailed insights about products and their sales.

While working on this, I discovered a few data quality issues, such as missing values in key fields (like purchaseDate and totalSpent) and inconsistent formatting (such as state abbreviations). These issues were identified during my review of the datasets, where I cross-checked for inconsistencies that could affect data reliability.

To resolve these, I’d need clarity on certain business rules, especially regarding the accuracy and freshness of data in critical fields. This will help ensure that we align the model with your expectations and requirements.

Looking ahead, my focus is on ensuring the model can scale as we process more data. Some performance concerns include how quickly we can extract and query the data as the volume grows. I plan to address this by optimizing how we store and access data, drawing from past experience with optimizing APIs and ensuring efficient data extraction.

Let me know if you have any specific priorities or additional information you’d like me to consider as I finalize this.

Thanks,
Elif
